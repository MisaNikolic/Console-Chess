# Console-Chess

Simple console chess game written in basic java code, for two players, and for learning purposes.
You will have to import this project into your prefered Java IDE to run it.
This is my first public GitHub Repository, forgive me if there is anything wrong(missing, unclear, etc.).
Hope you like it, Enjoy!
